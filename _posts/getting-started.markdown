To help me learn, I asked AI to create me a roadmap of learning focused on
detecting common vulnerabilities for a small home network and building a Phoenix
LiveView monitoring dashboard. It made the roadmap where each month I focused on one topic, for example:

```
Month 1: Core Concepts & System Foundations
Study MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques
```


I'm a huge nerd and really into popular video game franchises like Warhammer 40K and Warcraft.
