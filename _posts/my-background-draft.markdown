I had an amazing profressor in college that taught classes on his lunch break. So when he wasn't heading up engineering at the nearby Nokia satellite office. He was teaching Intro to Web Development, Intro to Databases, and other courses throughout the semesters. They were electives, my required courses were all in Java. Which was fun, albeit extremely verbose and the course book was pretty much the just the Java docs in a thick ass book. My Web Development was much different, we learned how to search the web efficiently for things we needed to know. There was a book, but we didn't use it, our profressor told us on the first day that the only reason the class had a book was because it was a requirement of the school. We learned what a server was by starting one on our machine and connecting to it through our browser. Then we learned some rudimentary HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We solved problems in class by playing with scripts. He managed Software Engineers, he kept up the all the emerging tech and was excited by it. He shared his knowledge and passion with us and I fell in love with the field of development.
